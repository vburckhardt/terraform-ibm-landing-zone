# VSI on VPC Landing Zone (QuickStart Pattern)

![Architecture Diagram for the QuickStart Variation of VSI on VPC Landing Zone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-landing-zone/main/reference-architectures/vsi-quickstart.drawio.svg)

This pattern deploys the following infrastructure:

- An edge VPC with one VSI in one of the three subnets and a VPC load balancer in the edge VPC, exposing the VSI publicly.
- A jump server VSI in the management VPC, exposing a public floating IP address.

**Important:** This pattern helps you get started quickly, but it is not highly available or validated for the IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services.
